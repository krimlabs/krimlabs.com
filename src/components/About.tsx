        Hi, I'm Shivek, and Krim Labs is my interface to the digital world.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        I started my career writing code in 2008. Over the years, I evolved into
        a tech-bro. Having achieved moderate success, I now prioritise
        spiritual, physical and emotional health over everthing else. I run
        myself like a company. This is my dashboard.
