It's really hard to answer what I do, so I'm just going to say that I am an Internet person. Years of building tech businesses have taught me many things. I started as a developer, and I could code in PHP and create basic web apps. But as I grew up, it became more about SEO, marketing, and content design. As I continued to grow, it shifted towards finances, accounting, hiring people, and making sure I had the right lawyers and contracts to ensure my company, my employees, and my users are legally protected.

While I was building my company, PHP was not cool anymore. And I grew as a developer, so I learned Postgres, Node, and Clojure.

Along the way, I learned how to design, make videos, mix and master audio, and even dabbled in poetry to become a better marketer. I also learned how to use Canva, Figma, and Sketch. During times when my business wasn't thriving, I also learned how to be a consultant to make ends meet. I traveled to different parts of the world, mostly because I wanted to, but sometimes because my work required it. Through my travels, I met people, shared stories, learned about their backgrounds, and shared mine, making me feel like a citizen of the world. When people wanted to know how I got here, I started giving talks and learned how to be a public speaker.

So, what do you do?

If somebody asked me what I do again, I'll say what my new friend, whom I met at the grocery store and who also goes to my gym, said: 'So you are an Internet person?' Yes, I am an Internet person; that's a good description of what I do.
