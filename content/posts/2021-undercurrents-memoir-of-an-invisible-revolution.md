Human beings like to fight. They fight to enforce dominance hierarchies. No matter how much we want to be "equal", the truth is that nature doesn't work that way. Some people are always more equal than others. 

The ones in power work together to distract the ones in majority, but with little influence. Left vs right, black vs white, man vs woman, are mostly constructs propagated as a distraction. A good propaganda is rooted in reality, so people can relate to it. 

But history told us that tyranny and revolutions go hand in hand. The French overthrew monarchs, the colonies gained independence, slavery is mostly abolished, but the exponential rise of technology has led to new forms of control mechanics. The normies have been enslaved by their own desires. Their thoughts have been captured. Oldies might remember the thought injection machine everyone used to carry. The one that had an apple on the back and looked like a glass slab.

The government had completely robbed its people of value. Instead they issued their personal bonds, with pictures of so-called prominent figures. These bonds could be traded for bonds made by other geographic entities. Movement was and still is restricted. Our minds are so small and limited. They cannot grasp the expanse of reality and seek comfort in the temporary borders called countries. 

I seek hope in a new controversial tech that claims to address the problems of traditional finance.
