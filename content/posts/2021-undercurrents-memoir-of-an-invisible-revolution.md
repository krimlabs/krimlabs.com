Human beings like to fight. They fight to enforce dominance hierarchies. No matter how much we want to be "equal", the truth is that nature doesn't work that way. Some people are always more equal than others. 

The ones in power work together to distract the ones in majority, but with little influence. Left vs right, black vs white, man vs woman, hetero-sexual vs homo-sexual are mostly constructs propagated as a distraction. A good propaganda is rooted in reality, so people can relate.

But history told us that tyranny and revolutions go hand in hand. The French overthrew monarchs, the colonies gained independence, slavery is mostly abolished, but the exponential rise of technology has led to new forms of control mechanics. The normies have been enslaved by their own desires. Their thoughts have been captured.
