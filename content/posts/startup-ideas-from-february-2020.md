This month's startup ideas have 3 offerings:

## Text to social media ads

*Problem*

Most posters/ads/banners are not creative production, but just an aggregation of stock photos, graphics, and content.
This aggregation takes is a set of menial tasks like: 
- Search Stock Photo Sites
- Search Stock Graphic Sites
- Create a simple Design

*Solution*

Automate these tasks in an engine that can convert any text into a banner. 

*Target Audience*

Bloggers, Ad Agencies, Maybe People who make presentations.

*Implementation*

- A neural network that studies existing ad designs
- An NLP engine that parses a sentence, fetches relevant images and illustrations
- A design engine uses the neural net and fetched resources to create a variety of ads
- A user selects one or more ads and the neural net runs again, generating a new set
- Ultimately leading to every account with a slightly different accent of posters being generated

*Hypothesis to test*
- Can a neural engine create usable ads?


## Hindi Search Engine
This one is really tough in my position, but the point of these posts is not to worry about what is feasible. 

*Problem*

India is set to surpass China in terms of population, has over 627 million broadband users as of 2019 (that's only 17% of the population).
This number is continuously increasing, but there is no search engine designed to handle regional content.

*Solution*

Create a regional search engine to serve rural traffic. Users whose first or second language is not English. Like Yandex, but for India.


*Hypothesis to test*

Vague, can't say.


## MouseLess
### A universal navigation system

A mouse is nothing but a 2D pointing device. It's not as fast as a keyboard but is more versatile. 
What if we can reach every clickable thing on the screen without using the mouse?

For a power user like a developer, it could mean saving a lot of time that was used to drag the mouse.
The following images explain the idea better.

*The screen as we see it*

*On pressing Command, every clickable is given an address so it could be accessed instantly*

In the case above, pressing `Cmd + A` will click the blog link.

*Target Audience*
- Power Users
- Developers

*Implementation*
- A chrome extension that highlights all anchors and makes them instantly accessible or
- An os level service that creates this address overlay

*Hypothesis to test*
- Is a direct address is faster and more efficient than moving the pointer?
- Will it be possible to always highlight all anchor?
